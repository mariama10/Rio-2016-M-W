# Project1


When it comes to the Olympics, people desire to look at the results of a specific sport, country, or only see who won from a specific country. Also, women’s 
tournaments are not given much attention because they are not considered as important as men’s individual competition and even in today’s society, most 
people think “sports are not for women”. Therefore, I came up with three hypotheses to test my data:
1. Since “sports are not for women”, the number of female athletes is less than men athletes in the Olympics.
2. Women’s sports are not considered as important as men’s games because men are more likely to win medals, especially golds with higher points.
3. It is a fact that the USA has the most medals in the nation, however, men are “known” to bring most medals home
I extracted data from Olympics.com and chose the top 10 sports from RIO 2016 OlympicsGames. There are no possible biases with the data because I picked the
top five popular sports and selected individual men and women competitions. 
The end product of my analysis will be used to support my hypothesis or show it is false. Since I have three different hypotheses, the end product of my 
analysis has results which support my first hypothesis.
